    "# Data Anonymization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A hospital located in Oxford wants to conduct research to look at how a number of health conditions\n",
    "are related to age and gender. They also would like to look at the spatial distribution of the results. Finally, they would like to be able to get back to individual patients' information after the study is done.\n",
    "They outsource this task to a data analytics startup created by two\n",
    "Oxford grad students : ShaZen.\n",
    "Before transferring the data to ShaZen, the hospital needs to make sure its patients information\n",
    "is well protected, and therefore they conduct data anonymization using the K-anonymity method. \n",
    "\n",
    "They assess the risk of breach by an adversary to rather low, at 1%. Given that they want to bring the overall chances of re-indentification of their patients at about one in five hundred, what value of K should they choose? \n",
    "\n",
    "## The dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The data consists of the records of 100 patients with their name, age, gender, postcode, admission and discharge dates, and their diagnosis codes. \n",
    "Diagnosis codes are following the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th edition (ICD-10), a medical classification list by the World Health Organization. \n",
    "The ones present in the dataset are:\n",
    "- I519: Cardiac Arrest\n",
    "- J189: Pneumonia\n",
    "- E116: Complications of diabetes\n",
    "- A419: Scepsis\n",
    "- B20: HIV\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The method\n",
    "Let's remember the workflow of anonymisation, which will be implemented in the rest of the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine the release model: public or non plublic. \n",
    "- Determine the acceptable re-identification risk threshold.\n",
    "- Classify data attributes (direct, indirect, non identifiers).\n",
    "- Remove unused attributes.\n",
    "- Anonymise direct and indirect identifiers.\n",
    "- Determine actual risk and compare against threshold.\n",
    "- Perform more anonymisation if necessary.\n",
    "- Evaluate solution: does the utility meet the target?\n",
    "- Determine controls required.\n",
    "- Document the anonymisation process.\n",
